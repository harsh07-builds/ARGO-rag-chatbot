The Argo program is a global ocean observing system that uses autonomous robotic floats to measure the physical state of the ocean.

The primary objective of the Argo program is to improve understanding of ocean circulation and its role in the Earth’s climate system.

Argo floats collect essential data such as temperature and salinity, which are critical for studying heat transport in the oceans.

The Argo network provides continuous, real-time observations that were previously impossible using ships alone.

Before Argo, most ocean measurements were limited to surface observations or sparse ship-based sampling.

The Argo program revolutionized oceanography by enabling systematic measurements across the global ocean.

More than 30 countries contribute to the Argo program by deploying floats and maintaining data centers.

All Argo data is freely available to scientists, governments, and institutions worldwide.

This open-data policy supports transparency and international collaboration in climate research.

Argo observations are used by operational weather forecast models to improve short-term and long-term predictions.

The data also helps scientists understand ocean heat uptake, which plays a major role in global warming.

Oceans absorb more than 90 percent of the excess heat generated by greenhouse gas emissions.

Argo data allows researchers to track changes in ocean temperature over time and across regions.

The program also supports studies of sea level rise by monitoring thermal expansion of seawater.

Argo measurements are quality-controlled by national and international data centers.

The Argo Steering Team coordinates global operations and sets scientific priorities.

The program continues to expand with new technologies such as Deep Argo and Biogeochemical Argo.

These advancements allow measurements at greater depths and include additional chemical parameters.

Overall, the Argo program is a cornerstone of modern ocean and climate science.
