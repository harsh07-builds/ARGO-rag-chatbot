Argo floats are autonomous instruments that drift with ocean currents and periodically dive through the water column.

A typical Argo float operates on a repeating cycle that lasts about 10 days.

During this cycle, the float descends to a parking depth of approximately 1000 meters.

It remains at this depth for several days while drifting with subsurface currents.

After the drifting phase, the float descends further to a depth of about 2000 meters.

As it ascends back to the surface, the float measures temperature and salinity profiles.

These measurements create a vertical snapshot of ocean conditions.

Once at the surface, the float transmits the collected data via satellite communication systems.

After data transmission, the float deflates its external bladder and sinks again to begin a new cycle.

Most standard Argo floats operate down to 2000 meters, covering the upper ocean.

Deep Argo floats are capable of reaching depths of up to 6000 meters.

Biogeochemical Argo floats measure additional variables such as dissolved oxygen, nitrate, pH, and chlorophyll.

These measurements help scientists study ocean ecosystems and carbon cycling.

Argo floats are powered by long-life batteries designed to operate for several years.

A typical float remains operational for four to five years before battery depletion.

Over time, floats may be lost due to harsh ocean conditions or mechanical failure.

Despite these losses, the global Argo network maintains approximately 4000 active floats.

Floats are deployed from research vessels and commercial ships across the world’s oceans.

The wide distribution of floats ensures coverage of remote and previously under-sampled regions.

Argo floats provide consistent and standardized measurements, enabling reliable long-term climate analysis.
